###  Summary
As can be see from this analysis Oahu would be a great spot for the new business venture "Surf n' Shake" .  Now there is no guarentee about the high of the waves but it seems from past experience we can deduce that they would be great!  There is a greater chance of rain in the months of December but for vacationers travelling from cold climates this weather would be a welcomed relief from sub-zero temperatures!  Also the temperatures in December tend to be at leas 10 degrees cooler when considering the minimum temperatures but again comperable to even states like California (where the surfing is awesome!) this is realatively great weather! So surfs up!
