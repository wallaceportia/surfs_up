Tools for this analysis: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, FLASK, Jupyter Notebook and Python

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an informational report based on weather conditions in the island of Oahu, Hawaii.  This report would be pivotal in helping an investor, "W. Avy" and his board of directors to make an infornmed decison on becoming investors in a start-up surf shop,"Surf n' Shake". The report will be soundly backed by  statitical data from the weather patterns on the island Oahu.  W.Avy has provided us with some weather data to assist with the analysis.

## Results

### June Temp 
For the months of June from 1700 samples it was determined that the average mean temperature is 74.94F.  It was found that the standard deviation is 3.2, which suggests that there is not a great variation in the temperature. The minimum temperature is 64F and the max temerature 85F. It is important to note that 50% of the time the temperature is 75F and 75% of the times and greater it is 77F.(refer to histogram)

### Dec Temp
For the months of December for 1517 samples it was determined that the average mean temperature is 71F.  It is found that the standard deviation is 3.7, althought slightly higher than the months of June standard deviation the variation around the average is not a great variation in the temperature. The minimum temperature is 64F and the max temerature 83F. It is important to note that 50% of the time the temperature is 71F and 75% of the times and greater it is 74F.(refer to histogram)

## Other Considerations
As Mr. Avy pointed out from past experiences it is important to add to the consideration for the weather, the precipation.  As no one wants to balance a surf board, a shake and an umbrella in their hands!

### June Precipation
For the months of June from 1574 samples it was determnined that the average mean rainfall is .136 inches.  It was found that the standard deviation is .33, which suggested that there was not a great variation in the inches of rain.  It is important to note that 50% of the time there is .02 inches of rain and 75% of the times and greater there is only .12 inches of rain fall. The maximun amount of rainfall is 4.43 inches in June of 2010 appears to be an unusal record rainfall perhaps there might have been extreme weather that year with hurricanes.(refer to histogram)

### Dec Precipation
For the months of December from 1405 samples it is determnined that the average mean rainfall was .21 inches.  It was found that the standard deviation is .54, which suggested that there is not a great variation in the inches of rain, however it is more likely to vary than in June.  It is important to note that 50% of the time there is .03 inches of rain and 75% of the times and greater there is only .15 inches of rain fall. The maximum amount of rainfall was 6.42 inches in December of 2010 which like in June is suggestive of extreme weather.(refer to histogram)

###  Summary
As can be see from this analysis Oahu would be a great spot for the new business venture "Surf n' Shake" . Now there is no guarentee about the hight of the waves but it seems from past experience we can deduce that they would be great!  There is a greater chance of rain in the months of December but for vacationers travelling from cold climates this weather would be a welcomed relief from sub-zero temperatures!  Also the temperatures in December tend to be at least 10 degrees cooler 56F when considering the minimum temperatures for the month of June 64F butcomperable to states to colder climates this fantastic. The one observation of a high degree of rainfall and that is comparative to other rainfall records in Oahu was the year 2010.  We might deduce that this year might have had some hurricanes or other extreme weather pattern.  All in all Mr. Avy should be satisfied that that the weather in Oahu is condusive to setting up a surf and shake venture. This is great weather! So surfs up!
